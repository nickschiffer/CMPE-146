 * I2C Base class that can be used to write drivers for all I2C peripherals.
 *  Steps needed to write a I2C driver:
 *  - Inherit this class
 *  - Call init() and configure PINSEL to select your I2C pins
 *  - When your I2C(#) hardware interrupt occurs, call handleInterrupt()
 *
 *  To connect I2C Interrupt with your I2C, reference this example:
 *  @code
 *  extern "C"
 *   {
 *      void I2C0_IRQHandler()
 *      {
 *          I2C0::getInstance().handleInterrupt();
