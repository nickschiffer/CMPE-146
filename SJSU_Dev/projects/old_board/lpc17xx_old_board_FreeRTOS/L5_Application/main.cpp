 * @note  printf of %f is turned off to save memory, this can be configured at sys_config.h

 * @warning SPI bus usage notes :
 *      - You can read/write files from multiple tasks because it automatically goes through SPI semaphore.
 *      - If you are going to use the SPI Bus in a FreeRTOS task, you need to use the API at L4_IO/fat/spi_sem.h
