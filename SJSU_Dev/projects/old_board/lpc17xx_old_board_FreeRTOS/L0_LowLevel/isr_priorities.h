 * Interrupt Priorities
 *  0 - Highest

 *
 * Interrupts used in this project must NOT use higher priority than IP_SYSCALL, so
 * if IP_SYSCALL is set to 5, then interrupt priority must be higher number than 5
 * in order to set it to lower priority.
 *
 * FromISR() FreeRTOS API cannot be called from interrupts that have higher priority
 * than IP_SYSCALL, which means that:
 *  - YOUR ISR must have numerically equal to or HIGHER value than IP_SYSCALL
 *
 * The interrupts that use higher priority than IP_SYSCALL MUST NOT USE FREERTOS API.

     * RIT is special because it allows us to deal with FreeRTOS API in case FreeRTOS
     * is not running.  If RIT is NOT below SYSCALL, then all interrupts will get locked out
     * because FreeRTOS API may set BASEPRI register to IP_SYSCALL blocking all interrupts
     * below it.  We set RIT to higher priority than FreeRTOS, and we make sure we do
     * not use FreeRTOS API in RIT interrupt.  The RIT will then "recover" base priority
     * and set it to zero if it sees that FreeRTOS is not running.
