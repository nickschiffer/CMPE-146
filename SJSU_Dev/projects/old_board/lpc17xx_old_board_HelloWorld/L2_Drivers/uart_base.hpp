/**
 * UART Base class that can be used to write drivers for all UART peripherals.
 * Steps needed to write a UART driver:
 *  - Inherit this class
 *  - Call init() and configure PINSEL to select your UART pins
 *  - When your UART(#) hardware interrupt occurs, call handleInterrupt()
 *
 *  To connect UART Interrupt with your UART, reference this example:
 *  @code
 *  extern "C"
*   {
 *      void UART0_IRQHandler()
 *      {
 *          UART0::getInstance().handleInterrupt();
 *      }
 *   }
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  @warning This class doesn't work for UART1 due to different memory map.
 *  @ingroup Drivers
