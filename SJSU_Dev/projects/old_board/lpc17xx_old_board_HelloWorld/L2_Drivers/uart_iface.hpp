 * Uart Interface
 *
 * Interfaces are helpful to dynamically point this pointer or reference to different objects.
 * Suppose you have two UARTs and you wish to use one or the other depending on some configuration:
 *
 *@code
 *  UART0& uart0 = UART0::getInstance();
 *  UART1& uart1 = UART1::getInstance();
 *  OutputIface& out = (some_condition_here) ? uart0 : uart1;
 *
 *  // Now we can use "out" and call functions like:
 *  out.put("Hello World.  I am the output interface!")
 *@endcode
