 * SPI Flash memory is very slow at writing data in general, but can be improved :
 * If this is set to 1, flash pages are erased when a file is deleted such that these pages
 * can be written faster at a later time.
 * If this is set to 0, flash write may take longer, but erasing files will be MUCH quicker.
 *
 * Here is a comparison :
 *  Set to 1 : 700K file written @ 150k/sec, but erased in 25 seconds!!
 *  Set to 0 : 700K file written @  25k/sec, but erased in 50 milliseconds
 *
 * @note _USE_ERASE @ ffconf.h must also be set to 1 to use this feature.
